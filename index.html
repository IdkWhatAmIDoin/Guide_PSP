<h1><center>A guide for PSP CFW</center></h1>
<p><center>!!!WARNING: Half of the info are based off of/copied from some other sites or wololo.net. I'm not exactly a PSP hacker myself, but i'm sure this site will help you. Im also unsure if this will work the same on all PSP models, so go to wololo.net for a guide for PSP models other than PSP-3000. Update: I reviewed the wololo.net guides a bit more and its all the same for all models. You can safely use this on a model different than PSP-3000!</center></p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>This is the <a href="https://digiex.net/attachments/660pro-c2-zip.13618/">Pro CFW folder for 6.60</a>, this is the <a href="https://digiex.net/attachments/6-61-pro-c2_22-01-2015-zip.14263/">Pro CFW folder for 6.61</a> (To check version, go in Settings>System Settings>System Information)</p>
<p>PSP with atleast <a href="https://wololo.net/downloads/index.php/version/1583">version 6.60.</a></p>
<p>A Memory Stick Pro Duo, Memory Stick Pro-HG Duo, Memory Stick Pro-HG Duo HX</p>
<h3>Updating</h3>
<h4>Skip this step if you're already on 6.60/6.61!!!</h4>
<p>To update from an older version of PSP to 6.60/6.61, follow these steps:</p>
<p>The first option is through the internet. It's super easy, but the servers are i assume dead. You can try the other option: Updating through a Memory Stick.</p>
<p>The second option is updating through a Memory Stick. I wont make this guide too long so go to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Upgrade-Your-PSP-Firmware">this guide from wikiHow.</a></p>
<h3>Putting the CFW setup files onto the Memory Stick</h3>
<p>Now we're getting into the real step 1. First, if you have a Memory Stick that is compatible with PSP, there should be a Memory Stick reader somewhere lying around your house. I'd recommend the Memory Stick Pro Duo microSD Adaptor since it supports microSD and Memory Stick Pro Duo.</p>
<p>If you have all of the previous things checked out, download the Pro CFW folder, depending on your version of PSP. Extract it from .rar to a simple folder. Now, use your Memory Stick reader and plug in your Memory Stick you have. An explorer window will pop up. Go back to your Pro CFW folder, cause we need it right now. Copy the PSP folder, and paste it in your Memory Stick. If you get a replace popup, press "Replace All". There is also a seplugins folder, but i dont know whats it for. Regardless, paste it in your Memory Stick. Now...</p>
<h2>INSTALLING IT ON THE PSP</h2>
<p>Final step. You must plug the Memory Stick out of your Memory Stick reader like a real PSP hacker, and put it in your PSP Memory Stick slot. Go to the Games section and run the PRO-C Update game, and the CFW will install. Congratulations, you installed CFW on your PSP...... until you actually power it off. Yeah. Just run the Fast Recovery game every time you turn off and turn your PSP back on. Or, if you like to be a little more automated, you can download PSPIdent and do the same as i said about the CFW games. Plug in your Memory Stick, extract the PSPIdent .rar file, and put it in your Memory Stick. You can download PSPIdent <a href="https://digiex.net/attachments/pspident_075_21-10-2011-zip.13151/">here, </a>and put the Memory Stick back in your PSP. Run PSPIdent, and there will be a bunch of information about your PSP including your motherboard model and your PSP model. The 1.x or 2.x (x is a random number, doesnt mean anything to us) means your PSP is almost capable of running permanent CFW (the 1/2 means its a PSP 1000/PSP 2000). You can install this on any PSP 1000/PSP 2000 if the motherboard model isnt 88 v3. So, now you've got CFW. What now?                          PIRATE GAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There will be an ISO folder in your Memory Stick once you've installed CFW on your PSP. If there isnt one, create one. You can now download free PSP games in an .iso formant and it'll work. So, this is the end. Goodbye.</p>
